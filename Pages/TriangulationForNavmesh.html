            <h2>Polygon Triangulation for 2D Navmesh Generation</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                This was a short research project for a Gameplay Programming course, where we were free to choose our specific topic from the general theme of programming AI behaviour and navigation.
                Due to a personal interest in mathematics and algorithms, I chose to learn the basics of how 2D shapes are converted into a triangulated polygon that can be used with the standard node-based 2D navmesh feneration algorithms.
                My end result is capable of taking several overlapping walkable and non-walkable 2D meshes, combine them into one polygon, triangulate that polygon, and make it parseable to the navmesh generation algorithm provided by a university framework. Zhe image above demonstrates a basic AI being able to navigate the triangulated green floor to get to a specific end poiint.
