        <h2>Background</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            I completed my first bachelor in Falmouth University, where I studied Game Development - Art specialisation. Since I started in 2019,
            most of my course happened during the worst of Covid and lockdowns, so I got a lot of practical experience of working remotely in a group 
            to develop a game project.
        <br>
            After graduating, I elected to take several courses at another university, as I wanted to specialise in Technical Art, and took some programming
            courses to develop a better understanding of what my programmer colleagues do. I ended up falling in love with C++, and enrolled for the bachelor's programme.

        <p>
           Aside from the obvious hobbies that come with the territory of being a game programmer - gaming, modding Baldur's Gate 3, 
           debugging Skyrim crashes, and reading documentation for code languages and software (Did you know there were still TODOs in the script files for the released version of BG3?), I also enjoy:
        <br>
            - Learning languages: Currently planning to resume studying Chinese, and bring my German up to proper fluency.
        <br>
            - Making art, both digital and traditional
        <br>
            - Music, both listening to it, and making it - I enjoy singing in a choir and learning the violin
        <br>
            - Zine Projects: I enjoy working in group projects, and assisting with the graphics and formatting aspects of zine production.
