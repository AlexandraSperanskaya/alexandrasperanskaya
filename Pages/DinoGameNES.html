            <h2>NES Chrome Dino Game</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>
                I took the elecetive course "Retro Console & Emulator Programming", where the final assignment was to make a small project for the Mesen emulator - and then also run it on the actual original NES hardware.
                The project was a group one, due to the complexity and limited time. I worked with with my good friends <a href="https://matthiasooms.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color: teal;">Matthias Ooms</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yenzo-devos-275b31218/" target="_blank"  style="color: teal;">Yenzo Devos</a> to recreate the classic Chrome Dino Game. <br/>
                My part of the project was rendering and horizontally scrolling the environment around the dinosaur, as well as the scoring, some of the implementation of the animations, and some of the tilesheet organisation.
                Matthias' main feature was collision detection for triggering the game over, while Yenzo worked on the randomisation for the obstacle spawning and part of the tilesheet setup.
                
                *I am credited as Hades Speranskaya in the game.
